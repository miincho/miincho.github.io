            <span class="boldTitle">Look Sharp</span> <br>
            Man oh man, has anybody ever gotten as great a run of product placement as the folks who make Sharpies have over the last 12 days? With President Donald Trump shedding executive orders like a loon molting in springtime, his SPIKY STABBY SCRAGGLY SHARPIE SIGNATURE® was ubiquitous. All you can do is admire his allegiance.

            But what, exactly is an executive order? Or, as my colleague Sarah Green Carmichael put it: “Why is everything an EO and not just a press release?”2 While the president seems to be doing his best to blur that distinction, it got me curious: Where did executive orders come from? Why do we need them? Are there enough Sharpies in the world to keep up with the Donald?
            
            <br><br>

            I’ll deal with that last one first: Sharpie maker Newell Brands reportedly produces up to a billion markers a year,3 so we probably won’t have to worry about a Trump-induced shortage of permanent markers. However, thanks to his fondness for tariffs, we will have to fret about Trump-induced shortages of plywood, tequila and guac (just in time for the Super Bowl!) and, most seriously, of lobster rolls, both the yummy hot kind and yucky mayonnaise-y ones.
            <br><br>
    
            As for those other questions, since life is short, I’ve decided to let the folks at the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara do all the legwork. Those clever folks tell us that an EO is “a rule or order issued by the president to an executive branch of the government and having the force of law.” But here is where things get hinky: “There have always been many forms of Presidential orders in addition to the numbered Executive Orders and Executive Order ... currently, these commonly are called ‘Memorandums’ but can have many titles.” Like, say, press releases?
            <br><br>
            Anyway, George Washington issued the first EO, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the most (3,721) and somehow Calvin Coolidge managed to issue 1,203 in his somnambulant single term. By last Wednesday, according to the APP, Trump had issued 44; consulting the back of an envelope, I find that puts him on a pace to produce 7,137 SPIKY STABBY SCRAGGLY SHARPIE SIGNATURES® before his term expires. Again, folks, don’t panic: a billion (maybe?) Sharpies a year!
            <br><br>
            What has this permanent-marker mayhem accomplished? Let’s begin with the not-so-sudden death of diversity, equity and inclusion tactics. Not only did Trump blame — without any evidence — the tragic mid-air collision in Washington last week on DEI, he signed multiple orders to end the practice at the federal level and in the private sector.
            <br><br>
            Stephen L. Carter has mixed feelings about Trump’s crusade against these policies, which were already on the ropes before he took office. “Right-leaning activists have for years been chronicling what they consider abuses committed in the name of diversity, and some of the stories are true and troubling,” he writes. “But undoing the worst abuses while helping the nation heal the still-open scar of race requires more careful consideration and surgical precision than what Trump’s blunderbuss of an order provides.”
            <br><br>
            Other writers are less ambivalent. “There’s also a deep sense of frustration with how completely DEI has been rebranded by anti-diversity activists as anti-White, anti-male discrimination,” writes Sarah Green Carmichael. “Of course, that’s not what DEI is. These programs seek to address documented disparities in organizations — for example, a problem retaining high-potential female employees, or an advancement gap facing Hispanic and Black engineers.”
