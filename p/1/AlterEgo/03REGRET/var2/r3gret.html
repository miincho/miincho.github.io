                <br><br><br><br>
                <span class="randomFont"> We all have experienced regret, </span> perhaps after making a hurtful comment or acting in a way that later turns out to be harmful. <span class="randomFont">Regret is a feeling of sadness, repetance, or disappointment at something that you have done, or failed to do. </span>
                The regrets that will <span class="randomFont">trouble us the most </span>are not the <span class="randomFont">mistakes</span> or <span class="randomFont">errors</span> we made,
                but rather the <span class="randomFont">actions we failed to take.</span>
                Their study explores the <span class="randomFont">psychology</span> of the <span class="randomFont">ideal self</span>, its relationship with our most fierce regrets,
                and how it is possible to turn a <span class="randomFont">regret</span> into something positive.   
                <br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">Psychologists consider that three main domains make up the perception of the self.</span>
                <span class="randomFont">Your “actual self” is who you currently are;</span>
                <span class="randomFont">your “ought self” is who you think you should be based on your obligations or responsibilities;</span>
                <span class="randomFont">your “ideal self” is who you could be, or who you might dream of being.</span>
            </div>

            <div class="content2">
                <span class="content_title">The <span class="randomFont">Exp</span>erience of <span class="randomFont">Regret</span> can Lead to <span class="randomFont">Positive Out</span>comes</span>
                <br><br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">Research suggests that regret can help to make sense of <span class="randomFont">past experiences</span>, facilitates future behaviours, provide insights into the self, and even helps to preserve social harmony. The following strategies could help you to manage regret to positively support your sense of self.</span>
                <br><br>
                The first step in managing regret is to ascertain what sort of person you are. If your <span class="randomFont">ideal self is filled with big dreams or aspirations</span>, consider what is stopping you from taking risks. <span class="randomFont">Perhaps a desire to be closer to your family prevents you from taking a job that would require significant travel.</span> <span class="randomFont">The importance </span>of remaining financially secure might be the stumbling block that prevents you from taking the plunge as an entrepreneur. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">If being separated from family or risking your savings would cause deep regrets</span>, then this may explain why you have not met the<span class="randomFont">goals</span>  of your <span class="randomFont">ideal self</span>. Having a better understanding of what you are willing<span class="randomFont"> — or more importantly unwilling — </span> to gamble with can be beneficial in soothing regrets about inactions. <span class="randomFont">Recognising that the compromises you have made</span> are the best fit for your three domains of self-perception can lift the burden of regret about inactions. 
                <br><br>
            </div>
            

            <div class="content3">
                <span class="content_title"><span class="randomFont">Failure to Live up to our Ideal Self</span></span>
                <br><br><br>
                Unlike the immediate anxiety and guilt that occurs following an undesirable action, a gradual unfolding of disappointment occurs when our goals and aspirations go <span class="randomFont">unmet</span>. <span class="randomFont">Regret of not going to drama school</span> may not rear its head until <span class="randomFont">years later when you find yourself stuck in an unenjoyable career</span>.
                <br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">Failure to live up to your ideal self is more frequently left <span class="randomFont">unresolved</span>, but reframing can help to shift the burden of <span class="randomFont">regret</span>. <span class="randomFont">Regret is a difficult but effective tool for learning</span>. The key is to find a way to grow from your <span class="randomFont">regrets without loathing yourself for past decisions</span>. For example, you could investigate what you could change in your current role to take steps towards your ideal self.</span>
                <br><br>
                Regrets of <span class="randomFont">past inaction</span>, however, do not give us the same forward drive. If you <span class="randomFont">decided not to apply for veterinary school in your adolescence</span>, you may spend your adult life filled with <span class="randomFont">regret that you do not have a career as a vet</span>. Overcoming regret is a harder task when you don’t have any <span class="randomFont">past action to learn from</span>. In fact, a study found that whilst regret about actions reduces over time, regret related to inaction tends to be more enduring, and can even intensify as time goes by.

            <div class="content4">
                <span class="content_title"><span class="randomFont">Regret</span>Has Value In <span class="randomFont">Motivat</span>ing Corrective Action</span>
                <br><br><br>
                Holding on to <span class="randomFont">regret</span> can be incredibly painful. <span class="randomFont">Regret of an action can occur instantly but can lead to a desire not to repeat the behaviour</span>. Inaction does not trigger the same immediate regret, but instead causes long term disappointment and “what if” rumination.
                <br><br>
                If <span class="randomFont">fear has led to you turning down dream jobs or stopped you falling in love</span>, learn from the <span class="randomFont">regret these decisions left you with</span>. The <span class="randomFont">psychology of regret suggests that you are more likely to regret the things you do not do than the actions you take</span>.
                <br><br>
                If you are unsure about a choice, it may be best to behave in a way that is <span class="randomFont">active, rather than inactive</span>. If you later come to <span class="randomFont">regret the action, chances are the regret will be less intense than if you had declined to act</span>.
                <br><br>
                Despite being a difficult emotion, <span class="randomFont">regret has value in motivating corrective action</span>. The presence of <span class="randomFont">regret can be used to propel you into acting in a way that makes reparations for past decisions</span>. If you miss an opportunity, <span class="randomFont">peace can be found later in life by investigating the psychology behind your choices, and acting to feed your desires in a new, yet satisfying, way</span>.
