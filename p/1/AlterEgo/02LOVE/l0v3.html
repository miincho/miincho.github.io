                <br><br><br><br>
                <span class="randomFont"> Can we do without love?  </span> <span class="randomFont">For many years, the neuroscientist Stephanie Ortigue believed that the answer was <span class="randomFont">yes.</span> Even though she researched the science of human connections, Dr. Ortigue — an only child and, in her 20s and 30s, contentedly single — couldn’t completely grasp its importance in her own life.
                “I told myself that being unattached made me a more objective researcher: </span> <span class="randomFont"> I could investigate love without being under its spell, </span>” she writes in her new book, “Wired for Love: A Neuroscientist’s Journey Through Romance, Loss and the Essence of Human Connection.”
                <br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">But then, in 2011, at age 37, she met John Cacioppo at a neuroscience conference in Shanghai. Dr. Cacioppo, who popularized the concept that <span class="randomFont">prolonged loneliness </span> </span>can be as toxic to health as smoking, intrigued her. <span class="randomFont">The two scientists fell hard for each other</span> and married. <span class="randomFont">She took his last name and they soon became colleagues at the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Medicine (where she now directs the Brain Dynamics Laboratory) — forming a team at home and in the lab. </span>

            <div class="content2">
                <span class="content_title">What <span class="randomFont">Exactly</span> <span class="randomFont">Lo</span>ve Does to the <span class="randomFont">Brain</span></span>
                <br><br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">You went from being happily <span class="randomFont">single</span></span>, to coupled, to then losing your husband. <span class="randomFont">How did meeting him</span> bring your research on love to life?
                <br><br>
                When we first met, <span class="randomFont">we spoke for three hours</span>, but I couldn’t feel time go by.<span class="randomFont">I felt euphoria — from the rush of dopamine. I blushed — <span class="randomFont">a sign of adrenaline.</span></span>  We became closer, physically, and started imitating each other. This was from the activation of mirror neurons, a network of brain cells that are activated when you move or feel something, and when you see another person moving. When you have a strong connection with someone, the mirror neuron system is boosted.
                <span class="randomFont">We quickly became “we.” When John was sick, I went to his radiation treatments. We shared a hospital bed. We were always together.</span>
                What exactly happens to the brain when we are in love?
                <br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">When we’re falling in love with someone, the first thing we notice is <span class="randomFont">how good it feels.</span> It’s because the brain releases feel-good neurotransmitters that boost our mood. </span> When we find love, it is like biological fireworks. <span class="randomFont">Our heart rate is elevated, </span>our levels of the so-called love hormone oxytocin are rising, which makes us feel connected. <span class="randomFont">Our levels of the hormone and neurotransmitter norepinephrine are spiking, which makes us lose track of time; our levels of adrenaline rise, which expands <span class="randomFont"> the capillaries in our cheeks</span> and makes us flush.</span>
                Meanwhile, <span class="randomFont"> our levels of serotonin</span>, a key hormone in regulating appetite and intrusive anxious thoughts, fall down. <span class="randomFont">So when we are in love</span> we might find ourselves eating irregularly or fixating on small details, <span class="randomFont"> worrying about sending “the perfect text,” “saying the perfect words” and then replaying the text or the phone call over and over again in our head. </span> 
                <br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">Then, when we start feeling a deep sense of calm and contentment with our partner, brain areas are activated that trigger not just basic emotions, but also more complex cognitive functions. </span> This can lead to several positive results, like pain suppression, more compassion, better memory and greater creativity. Romantic love feels like a superpower that makes the brain thrive.

                <span class="content_title">Is <span class="randomFont">Love <span class="randomFont">Neces</span>sary for </span>Survival?</span>
                <br><br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">Love is a biological necessity, just like <span class="randomFont">the air we breathe</span>, <span class="randomFont">daily exercise</span>, and <span class="randomFont">nourishing food</span>. A <span class="randomFont">healthy love life</span>, including your partner, closest friends, family ties, and favorite sports team camaraderie, is as essential as a <span class="randomFont">thoughtfully balanced diet</span>.</span>
                <span class="randomFont">Love, in the holistic, expansive way I am now conceiving of the term, is the opposite of <span class="randomFont">loneliness and emotional isolation</span>.</span> When we look at the <span class="randomFont">absence of positive and healthy relationships</span>, we see a cascade of physical and mental disadvantages — from <span class="randomFont">persistent depression and mood disorders</span> to high blood pressure, <span class="randomFont">diabetes-related health challenges</span>, and <span class="randomFont">fragmented sleep patterns</span>.
                If you don’t feel that you have a meaningful and fulfilling relationship, it’s as if you are <span class="randomFont">thirsty for social connection and emotional resonance, and your brain sends a signal to tell you that you need to </span><span class="randomFont">actively nurture your social body and relational well-being</span>. 
                <br><br>
                Some of the same <span class="randomFont">alarms activated when people are thirsty</span> are triggered when people feel <span class="randomFont">socially disconnected and emotionally isolated</span>. The key is not to suppress these <span class="randomFont">feelings of isolation and yearning</span>. They are meant to help us survive; we are meant to do something about it.
                But isn’t there still a <span class="randomFont">stigma in admitting that we’re lonely</span>? No one feels <span class="randomFont">guilty or ashamed</span> when they are <span class="randomFont">thirsty for human connection</span>, right? So no one should feel <span class="randomFont">guilty or stigmatized</span> when they are <span class="randomFont">lonely and seeking meaningful bonds</span>. There is a paradox in loneliness and social isolation; we want to approach others, but the <span class="randomFont">lonely mind</span> has been <span class="randomFont">lonely for so long that it detects more threats</span> — inaccurately, of course — and makes you want to <span class="randomFont">withdraw from potential connections</span> rather than approach others.

                <br><br><br>
                <span class="randomFont">Love doesn’t have to be with a living person. If you are really in love with life, with your passion, with your hobby, it can also be a <span class="randomFont">buffer against loneliness</span>.</span>
                <span class="randomFont">How can we help those we care about but who are <span class="randomFont">isolated</span>?</span>
                For years, people have thought that to help people who are lonely, you have to put them together. But the worst thing you can do for a lonely person is try to help them without asking them for help in return — a concept based on <span class="randomFont">mutual aid and protection</span>. Instead, we need to help them have a new sense of worth. We can ask them for their <span class="randomFont">advice</span>. Being shown respect, being depended upon, being made to understand your own importance — all these things can give a lonely person a sense of worth and <span class="randomFont">belonging</span> that decreases feelings of isolation.
                <span class="randomFont">Does long-distance love, love after a breakup or love for someone who has died affect the <span class="randomFont">brain similarly</span>?</span>
                <br><br>
                Yes, you can stay connected with others even if you are <span class="randomFont">physically alone in a room</span>.
                <span class="randomFont">Close your eyes right now and think about the person you love the most. Now, think about the last time you made them laugh out loud. Does that bring a <span class="randomFont">smile to your face</span>? We store these positive memories in our mind, and we can access them any time. We have the <span class="randomFont">remote control</span>.
