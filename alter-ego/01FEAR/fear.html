                <span class="content_title">How Your Worst Fear Affects Your Personality</span>
                <br><br><br><br>
                All of us have fears. You may be scared of spiders, flights, or enclosed spaces. Before coming into contact with our fear, 
                we are often able to prepare ourselves mentally. If you’re afraid of heights, you brace yourself before going to the top 
                floor of a skyscraper. If you’re scared of spiders, you keep a bug spray next to your bed at night just in case.
                Your actions are (often subconsciously) motivated by the fact that you’re trying to avoid your biggest fear.
                While you might be afraid of the dark or going to the dentist, it is the more debilitating fears that often 
                shape our personalities.
                <br><br>
                When you fear the inevitable, such as getting sick or dying, you know that your time will come.
                Even though most fears are out of our control, we work to avoid and delay the experience as much as humanly possible.
                We do small things each day to avoid coming in contact with our biggest fear. Then, when we look back at our lives, we 
                come to realize that much our time was wasted trying to avoid the inevitable.
                How does this constant avoidance shape our personalities, even when we don’t realize it?
            </div>

            <div class="content2">
                <span class="content_title">You Feel Out of Control and Helpless</span>
                <br><br><br>
                When you know that your fear is inevitable, you’re acknowledging the fact that you have no control. You will, undoubtedly, 
                live through your biggest fear. This can make us feel out of control and hopeless, giving us more anxiety. No matter how 
                hard we try, we won’t be able to avoid our phobia forever. The more anxious we are about the unknown, the more we build it 
                up in our heads. Often, your fear-inducing experience is not nearly as uncomfortable as the years you’ve spent trying to 
                avoid it. That being said, our minds have no way to predict the unknown.
                <br><br>
                We feel as if we have no logical way to prepare for our fear, so we spend our time worrying about it instead. If you could 
                will your way out of worry, everyone would be calm. You limit your activities. In nature, phobias are life-limiting. You’re 
                likely to avoid any situation that has the chance to induce your fear. Depending on the prevalence of your fear, you’ll avoid 
                certain activities. I have emetophobia (fear of getting sick), and I avoid certain foods, theme parks, sharing drinks, 
                medications, and much more. 
                <br><br>
                If you have agoraphobia, which is the fear of crowded places/leaving the house, you may find it challenging to go to parties, 
                restaurants, or even the grocery store. Phobias can significantly impair your education, career, and relationships, since 
                you’re likely to limit yourself to the selective activities in which you feel safe.

            <div class="content3">
                <span class="content_title">You are more likely to be introverted…due to isolation and embarrassment</span>
                <br><br><br>
                Depending on the prevalence of your fear, your phobia could impact your willingness to hang out with friends or put yourself 
                in any social setting. The justification of your fear-avoiding behaviors is likely to cause embarrassment.
                <br><br>
                How do you explain to somebody that you don’t want to go on the trip because you’re afraid of flights? Even once you arrive 
                at your destination, you’ll be dreading the flight home, which impacts your entire demeanor on the trip.
                Many people fear public humiliation, and when we encounter situations that induce our fear, we are likely to have anxiety. 
                Having this anxiety in front of others will cause embarrassment, only reinforcing our fear of public humiliation in the first place.
                This may cause us to avoid other people or anxiety-producing situations altogether, leading to more social isolation and introversion.

                <span class="content_title">How to stop fear from controlling your life</span>
                <br><br><br>
                Going out into the world and trying new things will always force us to branch out and push past our comfort zones. 
                Chances are, you won’t come into contact with what you fear most. If you do, it won’t be as bad as you imagined.
                Politicians, companies, and the media often profit off of fear, creating a widespread feeling of unease in modern 
                generations. Hearing about nothing but catastrophes causes us to fear what might happen next continually. Luckily, 
                there are mental tactics that we can use to improve our mindset.
                <br><br>
                Ask yourself: What if?
                While this may sound counter-intuitive, it’s a quick 2-step process that can ease your anxiety in seconds.
                First, ask yourself: What if?
                Then, ask yourself: Then what?
                Chances are, even if you do experience the most fear-producing situation, you’ll be fine afterward.
                By doing this quick mental exercise, you’ll program your mind to realize that encountering your biggest fear won’t 
                ruin your life in the end. Time after time, humans tend to return to a normal state.
                Acceptance > avoidance
                Be aware, but don’t fixate.
                Trying to avoid thinking about your biggest fear will only make you think about it more. Instead, try accepting your 
                fear and acknowledge your anxiety. Then, let the thought pass like a cloud on a sunny day.
                This way, you’ve spent your time having anxiety, and it will be much easier to move on now that you’ve acknowledged 
                and accepted your fear.
