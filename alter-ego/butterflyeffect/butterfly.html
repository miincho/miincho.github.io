                (in chaos theory) the phenomenon whereby a 
                minute localized change in a complex system 
                can have large effects elsewhere.

                The term is closely associated with the work of mathematician and 
                meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz. He noted that the butterfly 
                effect is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of 
                a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) 
                being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly 
                flapping its wings several weeks earlier. Lorenz originally used a 
                seagull causing a storm but was persuaded to make it more poetic 
                with the use of a butterfly and tornado by 1972. He discovered 
                the effect when he observed runs of his weather model with initial 
                condition data that were rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner. 
                He noted that the weather model would fail to reproduce the results 
                of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change 
                in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.

                The influence of the concept can be seen in the films The Terminator, 
                Back to the Future, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Maheshinte Prathikaram and Cloud Atlas.

                In the 1990 film Havana, the character played by Robert Redford states, "A butterfly 
                can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean", 
                and scientists "can even calculate the odds".According to science journalist Peter Dizikes, 
                the films Havana and The Butterfly Effect mischaracterize the butterfly effect by asserting 
                the effect can be calculated with certainty, because this is the opposite of its scientific 
                meaning in chaos theory as it relates to the unpredictability of certain physical systems; 
                Dizikes writes in 2008, "The larger meaning of the butterfly effect is not that we can readily 
                track such connections, but that we can't."
                <br><br>
                In the 1993 movie Jurassic Park, Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum) attempts to explain 
                chaos theory to Dr. Ellie Sattler (played by Laura Dern), specifically referencing the butterfly 
                effect, by stating "It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems", and "The shorthand 
                is 'the butterfly effect.' A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking, and in Central Park, you get 
                rain instead of sunshine."

                Other examples include Terry Pratchett's novel "Interesting Times", which tells of the magical 
                "Quantum Weather Butterfly" with the ability to manipulate weather patterns. The 2009 film Mr. 
                Nobody incorporates the butterfly effect and the concept of smaller events that result in 
                larger changes altering a person's life.

                "My Butterfly", an episode from the TV show Scrubs, features two separate timelines, each 
                influenced by the butterfly effect. The season four premiere episodes of Ugly Betty are named 
                "The Butterfly Effect Part 1" and "The Butterfly Effect Part 2", and a review of the episodes 
                in Vulture states, "Ugly Betty is certainly invested in the physics of the Butterfly Effect, 
                too: One small change can indeed cause large-scale effects."

                The concept is also incorporated into video games, including Eve Online. The 2015 video game Until 
                Dawn features the butterfly effect as a central plot point, using the concept to describe how player 
                choices can drastically affect the outcome of events. The video game series Life Is Strange, first 
                released in 2015, makes multiple references to the butterfly effect and uses it to describe how 
                player choices affect the plot of the game.

                The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of weather; it can easily be demonstrated in standard 
                weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain 
                that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial 
                conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has 
                no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to 
                grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct 
                impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat wrong." The two kinds of butterfly effects, 
                including the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and the ability of a tiny perturbation to create 
                an organized circulation at large distances, are not exactly the same. A comparison of the two kinds of 
                butterfly effects and the third kind of butterfly effect has been documented. In recent studies, it was 
                reported that both meteorological and non-meteorological linear models have shown that instability plays 
                a role in producing a butterfly effect, which is characterized by brief but significant exponential 
                growth resulting from a small disturbance.
                <br><br>
                According to Lighthill (1986), the presence of SDIC (commonly known as the butterfly effect) implies that chaotic 
                systems have a finite predictability limit. In a literature review, it was found that Lorenz's perspective on the 
                predictability limit can be condensed into the following statement:
                <br><br>
                By revealing coexisting chaotic and non-chaotic attractors within Lorenz models, Shen and his colleagues 
                proposed a revised view that "weather possesses chaos and order", in contrast to the conventional view of 
                "weather is chaotic. As a result, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC) does not always appear.
                 Namely, SDIC appears when two orbits become the chaotic attractor; it does not appear when two orbits move 
                 toward the same point attractor. The above animation for double pendulum motion provides an analogy. For l
                 arge angles of swing the motion of the pendulum is often chaotic. By comparison, for small angles of swing, 
                 motions are non-chaotic. Multistability is defined when a system (the double pendulum system) contains more 
                 than one bounded attractor that depends only on initial conditions. As a result, when two kayaks move along 
                 strong currents, their paths display SDIC. On the other hand, when two kayaks move into a stagnant area, they 
                 become trapped, showing no typical SDIC (although a chaotic transient may occur). Such features of SDIC or no 
                 SDIC suggest two types of solutions and illustrate the nature of multistability.

                <span class="content_titles accent">SYSTEM SENSITIVTY</span>
                <br><br>
                The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases 
                in semiclassical and quantum physics including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic Kepler problem. Some authors 
                have argued that extreme dependence on initial conditions is not expected in pure quantum treatments; however, the 
                sensitive dependence on initial conditions demonstrated in classical motion is included in the semiclassical treatments 
                developed by Martin Gutzwiller and John B. Delos and co-workers. The random matrix theory and simulations with quantum 
                computers prove that some versions of the butterfly effect in quantum mechanics do not exist.
                <br><br>
                Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Zbyszek P. Karkuszewski et al. 
                consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different Hamiltonians. They investigate the level 
                of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians. David Poulin et al. presented a quantum 
                algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which "measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected 
                to slightly different dynamics". They consider fidelity decay to be "the closest quantum analog to the purely classical 
                butterfly effect". Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or 
                velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in 
                the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. This quantum butterfly effect has been demonstrated 
                experimentally. Quantum and semiclassical treatments of system sensitivity to initial conditions are known as quantum chaos.
